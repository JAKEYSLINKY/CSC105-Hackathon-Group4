          The word "WHAL," which means whale in Thai, was inspired by tales of 52Hz, the world's loneliest whale. We intend for this website to serve as a haven on gloomy days.
Enjoy sorrowful songs and blue times while you're here at your leisure, and don't forget to grab some encouraging words from the sea bottle till you feel better.
Us, Whal developers recognize that we all live in the society that tending to be strong all the time is a must, But this is a kindly reminder that youâ€™re safe to be blue here.
Take Care and Take time.
